# Elevator App
This simulates a real elevator. 
## Version
Current: 1.00
# Usage
1. Pretty simple to use, just answer the questions the program asks and it will simulate an elevator. 
2. Note: This program uses a nearest floor mechanism so it goes in decreasing or increasing order. 
3. If the elevator state is up, and you input a lower floor, the lower floor will have low priority. 
4. If the elevator state is down, and you input a higher floor, the higher floor will have low priority
